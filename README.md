## Tuesday:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/131iZ7z3XKBjAGcB8qUqX9y0B2FxsoYu0zjRy6KxObPg/edit#
- This involves two projects, in the folder called 02_Tuesday:
-- Point, 
-- Customer 
Where the exercises are solved. 

## Wednesday:
For Wednesday, the following tasks are implemented:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gdtrSIb_RiEE3qv5hPwrzBrNaowHA-MPFXR8LP9CKJk/edit
- This involves one project, in the folder called 03_Wednesday:
-- rest1
All the tasks were implemented.


## Thursday:
For Tuesday, the following tasks are implemented:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c4uti7oLiipp1Sdny9Rwc1aOStfn9aasmWhhhzuTQS8/edit
- This involves two projects, in the folder called 04_Thursday:
-- week1-simple-jpa-rest
-- jpl-demo-for-day4
I have implemented a solution to all of the tasks.
I however had some concerns regarding testing GSON String facade methods.
I left an example of how I attempted to handle the testing, to demonstrate, but commented it out, because it wasn't working.

I also deployed the solutions to my Droplet, which can be found here:
http://161.35.24.227:8081/jpa_rest_startup-1.0/

As an API example:
http://161.35.24.227:8081/jpa_rest_startup-1.0/api/employees/id/1

## Friday:
For Friday, the following tasks are implemeneted:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HdHiORGNyteRpn7MoOixowxL10LQuUHt9XxAKtL9r0o/edit
- This involves one project, in the folder called 05_Friday:
-- rest-jpa-devops-startcode
The whole docs-task is implemented, although it was optional.
As a side note, JUnit is also implemented, and done. And because I handled the facade methods differently, 
by returning an object instead of a GSON string, I also knew how to successfully test the methods. 
 I also published the work to my droplet:
http://161.35.24.227:8081/devops-starter-1.0.1 ; and then just change the corresponding URL to match the API, eg.:
http://161.35.24.227:8081/devops-starter-1.0.1/api/bank/all

All the solutions can be found on the Github Repository. They are however all in one initial commit though, which can be seen here:
